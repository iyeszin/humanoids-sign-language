abstract: |
  This paper explores recent developments in the recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) to enhance human-robot interaction (HRI). Current methods utilizing publicly available datasets are reviewed to identify their contributions and areas for improvement. A comprehensive survey of the literature is conducted, emphasizing the integration of ASL recognition systems within a ROS2-based framework to improve communication accessibility. The study examines the effectiveness of using landmarks to improve the accuracy of fingerspelling recognition. These findings offer practical insights for advancing ASL recognition systems and underscore the need for more integrated approaches in HRI.

  - title: The HSI-SL framework
    text: |
      Our research introduced a ROS2-based framework specifically designed for fingerspelling recognition, implemented with a realistic dexterous robot hand to simulate human-like movements. The framework seamlessly integrates a deep learning-based inference node for gesture recognition, a chat agent node for processing and response generation, and a hand position controller node to manage the robotic hand's movements, ensuring fluid communication.

      Key insights into the effectiveness of a predictive text system are shown by the Table 1 and Table 2 that compares original sentences with their matching predicted sentences from both training and validation sets. Typical mistakes show potential areas for model improvement, such as phonetically similar but incorrect substitutions and improper initial letters. Including methods for correcting mistakes, along with additional training focused on improving sensitivity to the beginnings of words and sentences, could be beneficial.
